Choose the ID just under the Buddy Param script ( you'll be using an actual summon you have, just changing which NPC it summons). 2. There wil be red fields NPC ID and NPC Think ID , that's the enemy/boss the item will Summon and it's AI, respectively, just choose the ID of which you want to summon, it'll be the same ID in both fields. 3. Almost all IDS are from enemies, so to make then work like an actual spirit summon you'll need to:  Go to NPC Param script and place the boss/enemy ID in the ID section ( It'll be the same ID used in the NPC ID field of the summon spirits script. The red field called team type is the enemy/boss behaviour towards you, just change it to 47 - spirit summon ( it'll be the last one). 4. After that you can just summon the spirit ashes you've changed and the boss/enemy you selected the ID should pop up.  5. To make him follow you you edit SpEffectId27 to 297000  NOTES:  If you wanna edit a Summon with Multiple Spirits there will be multiple IDs one for each Spirit you will have to Change them one by one.  If there's a big one (like Rykkard), it'll probably fall to underground, just use NoGravity and NoClip to spawn it higher.  BuddyParam ID: Spirit you wanna edit to something else. NPC ID: ID of what NPC you want it to be instead NPC ThinkID: Usually the same exact ID can be anything you want it to be tho as long as you dont mind the altered moveset.
